  "description": "Unfortunately, cellulitis cannot be defeated by sports and diet alone, but anti-cellulite massage has long been proven to be effective. A special technique that is specifically focused on the upper fat layer of the skin accelerates blood and lymph metabolism and removes stagnant fluid from the cells. After a course of several massage sessions, cellulitis disappears, body fat melts, and the skin becomes firm and elastic due to an increase in the production of collagen and elastin.",
