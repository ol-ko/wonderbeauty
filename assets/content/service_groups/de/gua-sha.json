  "title": "Gua Sha",
  "description": "An ancient Chinese massage technique that uses special plates. The result is similar to acupuncture: due to the effect on particular reflex spots of the body, all metabolic processes improve, especially the circulation of lymph. This, in turn, significantly improves both the state of the body as a whole and the condition of the skin in particular."
