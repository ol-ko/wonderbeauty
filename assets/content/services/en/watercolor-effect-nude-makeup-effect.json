  "description": "In this case, the master selects a pigment that is as close as possible to the natural colour of the lips. Translucent, soft, natural shades are used. The pigment is applied to the entire surface of the lips so that the contour and filling practically merge with each other. This permanent makeup emphasizes the natural beauty of the lips, makes them incredibly sensual, perfectly corrects any flaws and is indistinguishable from the natural colour of the lips."
