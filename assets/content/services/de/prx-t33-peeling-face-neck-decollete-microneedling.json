  "description": "PRX-T33 is a combination treatment with MICRONEEDLING for the treatment of depressed scars and hyperpigmentation associated with acne. A course of three sessions, one month apart where at each session, a base layer of PRX-T33 is applied to the whole face, immediately followed by mechanical microneedling. This synergistic protocol provides the multiple benefits such as tightening of the depressed scar, lifting from the base, collagen induction and lightening of the post inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Significant improvements can be seen from the first session in both texture and tone of the skin. "
