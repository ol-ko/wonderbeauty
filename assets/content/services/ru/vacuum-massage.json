  "description": "Vacuum provides a deep effect on the tissue, that is rather impossible to achieve with other types of massage. Such an intense effect dramatically enhances the microcirculation of lymph and intercellular fluid, accelerates metabolic processes, engages new capillaries and blood vessels, improves the functioning of fibroblasts (cells responsible for collagen production). The result is fast fat burning and the eventual disappearance of cellulites."
