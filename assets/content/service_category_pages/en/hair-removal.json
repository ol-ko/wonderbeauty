  "description": "We offer all types of hair removal: such as laser, waxing, sugaring. To make it easier for you to choose, here are the pros and features of each method offered in our studio.\n\n## Laser hair removal\n\nLaser hair removal is the most modern and radical way to remove unwanted hair. Only it provides a truly long-term effect: the laser does not just remove hair, but destroys follicles, so after one or more courses of laser hair removal, unwanted hair can be forgotten forever. Or at least for years to come. However, this is in ideal case. In practice, the result strongly depends on which laser is used for hair removal. Lasers are very different - in terms of efficiency, capabilities, strength and duration of exposure, and finally, safety. Our principle is never to save our costs on health and beauty of our clients. Therefore, having thoroughly researched the market, we chose the most innovative and efficient model to utilise: the LightSheer DESIRE diode laser.\\\n\\\nWhy is it unique?\n\n* Laser power allows you to epilate at a record speed\n* Contact sapphire cooling technology makes the procedure almost painless\n* It works equally effectively with any skin photo type (as lasers of previous generations are practically useless for some photo types)\n* Provides the very ideal \"silky smoothness\" that you have been dreaming of all your life\n* Removes hair both in large and in the most sensitive areas\n* Absolutely safe: the finest settings allow targeted destruction of the follicles without damaging the surface of the skin.\n\n## Waxing\n\nWaxing is the oldest way to remove unwanted hair: they say it was practiced by the beauties of ancient Egypt. Thousands of years have passed, and it is still in demand: it is valued for its availability, security and guaranteed result. But the technology of waxing, of course, has gone far ahead: modern means have made it much more effective and comfortable than before.\n\nPros of waxing:\n\n* The result remains for a long time - 10 times longer than shaving.\n* Safety. No scratches, cuts, burns, damage to the skin (of course, if a skilled specialist performs hair removal)\n* After waxing, the hairs grow thinner and invisible, and eventually cease to grow.\n* Modern waxing products not only do not harm the skin, but also improve its condition. Thanks to the peeling that occurs during the procedure, the skin becomes softer, too.\n* Affordable and optimal in terms of price-quality ratio of hair removal.\n\n## Sugaring\n\nSugaring is the removal of unwanted hair with a special sugar paste.\n\nIts advantages:\n\n* Hypoallergenic and safe. The paste contains only natural ingredients, so the procedure is suitable even for allergic people and individuals with sensitive skin.\n* Gentle hair removal. The procedure does not injure the skin, does not leave any scars or burns.\n* No ingrown hairs. Hair is removed in the direction of their growth, so the follicles are not injured.\n* Skin care. During the procedure, the keratinized layer of the epidermis is removed; the skin becomes soft and smooth, as if after peeling.",
