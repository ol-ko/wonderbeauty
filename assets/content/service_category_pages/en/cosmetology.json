  "description": "We thoroughly analyse your skin and examine your medical and skincare history to formulate a tailored treatment and skincare plan that’s carefully designed to get the best results for your skin. We understand and treat all skin types and skin tones, focusing not only on what we can see, but also on achieving clarity, preventing future damage and maintaining skin health and radiance throughout the natural ageing process.\n\nAs part of your bespoke plan, we will handpick the best facial treatments to address your concerns and transform your skin. We recommend these are performed once per skin cycle (every 4-6 weeks) or more often if we’re targeting an acute condition such as acne. We constantly assess your progress with every treatment and make tweaks where necessary to ensure that you get visible and long-lasting results.\n\nWhilst cosmetic grade skincare only works on the surface layer of skin, at Wonder Beauty Zug, our medical grade products work deep within the skin to correct any damage and achieve long-lasting skin health and radiance."
